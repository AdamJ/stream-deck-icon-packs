A collection of icons for applications, controls, and websites that I used on my Elgato Stream Deck. [Download &amp; Install](/com.elgato.jolicoeurneonicons.streamDeckIconPack "Link to installable icon pack")

You can find the icons in my icon library on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1287072958179215150/switchback-icon-library "Link to icon library on Figma") or on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/22779287-Neon-Icons "Link to Dribbble shot").

### styling
All icons are framed at `144 x 144` pixels with an icon size of `126 x 126` pixels and are colored with a linear-gradient of `linear-gradient(180deg, #00D1FF 0%, #CC00FF 100%);`.

```css
fill/stroke: linear-gradient(180deg, #00D1FF 0%, #CC00FF 100%);
stroke-width: 10px
stroke-style: solid
background: linear-gradient(180deg, #00D1FF 0%, #CC00FF 100%);

## Customization

If you would like to customize this pack, or create your own, Elgato has a guide for [creating icon packs](https://docs.elgato.com/sdk/icon-packs/create-your-icon-pack "Link to Elgato's guide for creating icon packs"). To verify this icon pack, or any other that you may find (you must have the `com.elgato."pack-name".sdIconPack` folder), use the [ICON-PACK-MAN](https://iconpackman.elgato.com "Link to icon pack man site") site to verify that all necessary information is present and all icons conform to the Elgato requirements.

I've included an [example template](/sdk-template.sdIconPack "Link to template folder") (downloaded from Elgato) for reference.
